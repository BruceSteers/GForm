Runtime args when launching GForm

Notes...
Arguments are proccessed in the order they are written so some need to be issued before others.
For example using the arg 'allstretch' that will set the default expand option on all controls 
to true will only be set once it's read in the list , so any arguments to create 
controls/buttons/etc issued before the allstretch arg will not have their flag set. So it needs
to be issued before any controls. In the same respect you cannot issue the arg 'griditems' to 
add items to a gridview before issuing the arg 'gridview' to create the gridview.

version or ver , pops up a version info mesage and exits

-- Main window/Form related options...
title="Title for window top"
width=<n> , manually define a window width
font=font name , Sets the main form font Eg 'Carlito,14,Italic'
noresize , makes form non resizable
stretchall or allstretch , sets all objects to expand. (except any with the nostretch flag set)
topmost or toponly , forces window to stay above others.
seperator=text or sep=text , default arg seperator is '|' change it here if needed
listseperator=text or lsep=text , default list seperator is ',' change it here if needed

-- Object placement , By default each object is placed vertically in the GUI from top
-- to bottom. To place a row of objects Horizontally use the 'box' option
box , makes a Horizontal box, subsequent objects go in the box horizontally until unboxed
unbox , finishes the box

-- Controls...
button="name|text|flags" , makes a button (close makes button close the window)
toolbutton="name|text|flags" , makes a Toolbar style Button (close makes button close the window)
togglebutton="name|text|flags" , makes a ToggleButton, use 'on' to make it active
input="name|text|flags" , makes a TextBox for inputting text (also textbox does the same)
checkbox="name|text|flags" , makes a CheckBox , use 'on' for ticked
fontbox="name|FontName|flags" , makes a font choosing box
dirbox="name|path|flags" , makes a dirbox directory chooser
combobox="name|comma,seperated,list|index|flags" , makes a read-only combobox, index is selected number
listbox="name|comma,seperated,list|index|flags" , makes a list box, index is selected number
gridview="name|columns,comma,seperated|flags" , makes a grid list with rows and columns
griditems=gridview_name|row,1|row,2|etc|index , add one or more rows to the named gridview
label="name|text" , makes a label.

For all above objects the following 'flags' can be given as the last argument seperated by spaces. 
Eg, to create a text box that auto expands and is disabled use..
textbox=tname|My Text|stretch disabled
'on' for toggle button or checkbox state on load, 
'disabled' disables object, 
'hidden' hides the object, 
'stretch' or 'nostretch' forces object resizing or not
'readonly' for input box (or any other control that supports it)
'left' 'right' or 'center' for text alignment.
'noheader' , use with gridview to not show the column headers.
'close' or 'quit' makes button close GUI after pressed , 

spring , adds a spring, place to push objects, eg. "box spring button unbox" will push button to the right.

pipe="path/to/pipe" , name of the outgoing pipe file (Eg. /tmp/fifo1) GForms way of talking to your script
listen="path/to/pipe", name of listening pipe file (Eg. /tmp/fifo2) your scripts way to control GForm 

quiet , suppresses any stdout messages (not pipe messages)

return=<mode> ; set behaviour if not using the pipe feature, can be 'name', 'text', 'all' or 'collect'  or...
returnname or returnval, same as return=name , for use in button only requesters where one answer is expected
for example in a "Yes | No | Cancel" type of scenario, you would ideally name the buttons 0, 1 and 2 for ease.
return=name returns the 1st part, the name only of the button pressed.
returntext , same as return=text , like return=name but returns the 2nd part, only the Text of the button
return or returnall , same as return=all , rerturns both object name and text. eg. btn1|button 1

collect , same as return=collect , this supresses any messages during use but when the GUI is closed
all the objects names and fields are collected and returned to your script for proccessing.
(warning , collect mode is not impplemented yet)

Tips....
If object placement/sizing is being somewhat unexpected use the allstretch stretch and nostretch 
combinations and add springs to get better results.
