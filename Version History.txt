GForm Version History

V1.4.1
Found an issue with Gambas compiling the exe.
i did not know that Gambas puts the entire project folder into the compiled executable.
In the folder i had snapshots, bash scripts and i renamed the compiled GForm.gambas to just GForm
So every time i compiled the app it added the elready existing exe plus all the extra files to it, 
over and over again.
The executable file size was 26mb at one time and i didn't know how it got so big.
Now i have cleaned everything out of the folder and recompiled the App it is 
only 22.1kb

V1.4.0
Added stock icons.
run 'GForm geticons' to show all available stock icons and get their names, clicking an icon
 copies it's name to the clipboard. in the object flags simply add 'icon=name'
Added background/foreground colour flags , use R,G,B Eg, background=256,256,256 for white
Added TextArea , settext command works and also has a filetext=object_name|filename to 
  load a file directly or addline=Object_name|text to add lines.
added lines=number flag for textarea,listbox and gridview to set height.
Added inputbox=title|prompt|text for a pop up input box (returns output to pipe or shell)

V1.3.0
found a bug in the listening pipe routine where multiple lines of text were not being processed correctly.
and also a bug in the scripts using only one > to send text to the pipe thus overwriting unread messages.
both bugs fixed. this has solved a few odd bugs i was getting and made everything even more responsive.

Added gridview object and many commands for it
Made a GridView version of pkAppMan

V1.2.0
Stopped pipe reading being on a timer event and made it live with a File_Read event trigger, This made
a big difference in speed.
added more controls/commands
now it can work like zenity --question where you configure a text and as many buttons as you like
and when button is pressed it closes and returns the button info to stdout.

V1.1.1
Added some more controls and lots of commands
Added flags to enable,hide objects etc
added message for internal message box
noresize to stop window resize
fontbox and font commands
added dialog commands

V1.1.0
added listening pipe to send commands to GUI from the script.
added spring , manual width setting
added an example script to show listening pipe in action

V1.0
Initial build, not many controls, only an output pipe but funcional.
1 example script included
